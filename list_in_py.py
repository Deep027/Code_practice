# Creating a List 
# Here are some common methods to create a list: 
# Using Square Brackets

# List of integers
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# List of strings
b = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Mixed data types
c = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# Using list() Constructor
# From a tuple
a = list((1, 2, 3, 'apple', 4.5))  

print(a)

# Creating List with Repeated Elements
# Create a list [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
a = [2] * 5

# Create a list [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
b = [0] * 7

print(a)
print(b)

# Accessing List Elements
# Elements in a list can be accessed using indexing. 
# Python indexes start at 0, so a[0] will access the first element, while negative indexing allows us to access elements from the end of the list. 
# Like index -1 represents the last elements of list.
